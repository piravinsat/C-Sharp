GAME PLAN

Tower Defense, top down shooter, combined.
We will have a man controlled by the user, who has to place towers to shoot at 
enemies. The man can also shoot at enemies. Enemies will try and attack the 
players base. Some enemies will try and attack towers or the man.

So what class's do we need?
Player, bullet, tower, basicTower, splashTower, electricTower (etc), Mob, various
enemies that extend the basic Mob class, perhaps a resourceManager class to hold 
all textures in, Tile, level, Base, BaseItem (the things to buy)

Tower, Tile, and Mob are superclass's that more detailed class's will extend.
The main class should be solely used for updating/ removing objects... therefore
each class will have its own individual update and draw method.

The spawners will be special tiles where enemies come from.
Towers have health. The player does not have health, but can be slowed down.

Controls are WASD to move player, and space to shoot in direction of movement.
Z to pick up and place a tower/ acquire a ugrade.

As the game goes on, more spawners will appear in random places?

Enemy ideas? (Add your own)
Robots, aliens, zombies, mummies, Beavis...

Name of the game? (please add your ideas here)


Also should towers be allowed to be placed anywhere, or should we have a grid? 
Grids will be useful to implement a pathfinding algorithm, but no grid makes the
game free-er...

Any questions, put 'em here?
