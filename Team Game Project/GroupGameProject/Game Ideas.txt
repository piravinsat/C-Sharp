Game Ideas


Doom (Pretty unlikey)(Managed to get the cube showing, see 3DTest.png)

Pinball 

Shoot em' up

//Platformer (Unlikely, a bit boring)

Beavis and Butthead type shooting game (Two out of three love it), my individual game. (Plan B)

Bomberman (Pretty good idea)

Advanced Pong (Not very complex)

//SimCity (Very complex Ð No cat in hell chance)

Turn-based game like Advance Wars and Fire Emblem (Kind of too complex with the AI)

Tower defense game (Plan B)
	-Tower defense combined with top down shooter (man has to place towers, and can shoot at enemies)

//Party game (Too broad of an idea)

//Point and click game 

The fish game where become as you eat more fish

Dolphin Olympics type game

Skyrim 2 (An absolute sound and brillant idea)

Towers of Hanoi
